## Marketing Channels & Tactics

### 1) Landing Page & Registration
- Create a dedicated expo landing page with:
  - Clear value proposition, audience pain points, and benefits of attending.
  - Prominent CTA: “Reserve Your Spot” with a simple form (name, email, company, role, interest area).
  - Early-bird incentives (e.g., exclusive demo slots, downloadable whitepaper, swag).
  - A countdown timer to create urgency.
  - Social proof: logos of sponsors/partners (if any) and 1–2 short testimonial quotes.
- Post-registration follow-up sequence:
  - Confirmation email with agenda highlights, speaker lineup, and a reminder to add the event to calendars.
  - 1–2 reminder emails with new speaker reveals and a teaser about hands-on demos.
  - Final reminder 24 hours before the event.

### 2) Email Marketing
- Build a targeted list from existing customers, partners, and relevant industry contacts.
- Create a 3-email sequence (1–2 weeks) plus a last-chance reminder:
  - Email 1: Why attend, what you’ll learn, who is speaking.
  - Email 2: Exclusive demos, networking opportunities, and early-bird perks.
  - Email 3: Final registration push with a featured demo schedule.
- Personalize subject lines for higher open rates (A/B test variants):
  - “See how Ethree solves [industry-specific challenge] in 30 minutes”
  - “Exclusive demos and network opportunities at Ethree Expo”
  - “Last call: Reserve your seat at Ethree Solutions Expo”

### 3) Social Media Campaigns (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, YouTube Shorts)
- Content pillars: problem-solution teases, speaker spotlights, demo previews, testimonials, and event logistics.
- Posting cadence: 3–5 posts per week across platforms; 1–2 short videos per week.
- Lead-gen integration: direct links to the expo landing page in posts and in profile bios.
- LinkedIn: Sponsor/boosted posts targeting IT decision-makers and relevant job titles; in-market audiences for tech events.

## Registration & Attendance Goals
- Primary goal: At least 100 qualified attendees registered or RSVP’d.
- Target pace: Achieve ~25–30 registrations per week over the four-week window, with a 2:1 ratio of registrants who attend the live event to those who convert from virtual attendance (if hybrid).

## Registration Journey & Follow-Ups
- Stage 1: Visitor lands on the expo page; registers with basic info.
- Stage 2: Welcome email with agenda and speaker lineup; invitation to add to calendar.
- Stage 3: Reminder emails with new demo slots and partner sessions.
- Stage 4: On-site day-of event reminders, exit survey, and post-event on-demand access.

## Attendee Engagement Plan (During the Expo)
- Live participation: 3–4 demo stations; 2 expert-led sessions; 1 roundtable discussion.
- Networking: Structured introductions, speed-networking moments, and a dedicated lounge.
- Gamification: Expo passport; stamps earned for attending sessions and visiting booths; rewards for completing the passport.
- Post-event engagement: Access to session recordings, whitepapers, and a survey with opportunities for follow-up meetings.

## Metrics & KPIs
- Registrations: Target ≥100 sign-ups.
- Attendance rate: Target ≥60–75% of registrants (or best proxy: booth visits, session checks).
- Engagement metrics: Demo sign-ups, session attendance, and post-event downloads.
- Lead quality: Number of qualified leads and scheduled follow-up meetings.
- ROI: Registration-to-appointment rate, partner engagements, and sponsorship interest.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Low registrations
  - Mitigation: Increase partner promotions, introduce limited-time incentives, broaden targeting.
- Risk: No-shows on event day
  - Mitigation: Send reminders, offer virtual access, and host on-demand content after the expo.
- Risk: Budget overrun
  - Mitigation: Prioritize high-ROI channels; track cost-per-lead; adjust spend weekly.

## Next Steps
- Create the expo landing page draft and content assets.
- Build the 3-email sequence and social content calendar.
- Reach out to 2–3 potential partners for co-promotions.
- Confirm speakers and schedule for the expo day.
- Set up dashboards to monitor registrations, attendance, and engagement in real-time.
